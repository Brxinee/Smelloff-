## Before / After: Title Tags and Meta Descriptions

### Homepage (index.html)

**No changes** — title and description were already well-optimised:
- Title: `ODORSTRIKE Fabric Odor Spray for Clothes ₹229 | Smelloff` (55 chars ✅)
- Description: `ODORSTRIKE by Smelloff is a pocket fabric odor spray for clothes. Not perfume. Not deodorant. Not body spray. Kills sweat smell in 8 seconds. 50ml · ₹229.` (153 chars ✅)

### Blog Index (blog/index.html)

**No changes to title/description** — both adequate:
- Title: `Smelloff Blog — Fabric Odor, Sweat Science & Real Fixes` (56 chars ✅)
- Description: `The Smelloff blog. Real talk on why clothes smell, what actually kills odor, and the science behind ODORSTRIKE. Written by the founder.` (134 chars — slightly short, monitor)

### Blog Posts

Individual titles and descriptions were already optimised by the build script. Meta robots, og:locale, og:image:alt, twitter:image:alt were the gaps — all fixed.

---

## Phase 2 — Keyword Coverage

See `/SEO_KEYWORD_MAP.md` for full mapping.

Key gaps identified and addressed:
- FAQ section expanded to cover long-tail / AEO targets directly on homepage
- "About ODORSTRIKE" block provides Wikipedia-style entity paragraph for AI citation
- "Quick Answers" block provides 3 direct-answer extractions for AI engines
- Comparison table covers "ODORSTRIKE vs deodorant vs perfume" queries

**On-page keyword status (index.html):**
- H1 contains "fabric odor spray" and "sweat smell on clothes" ✅
- First 100 words include "fabric odor" naturally ✅
- FAQ H2s cover long-tail questions ✅
- No keyword stuffing detected (estimated density <1.5%) ✅

---

## Phase 3 — Structured Data Validation

### Homepage Schemas

| Schema | Present | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| FAQPage | ✅ | Fixed — expanded 5→13 Qs, synced with on-page | All Q&As match visible FAQ exactly |
| Organization | ✅ | Pass | Has logo, address, contactPoint, sameAs |
| WebSite + SearchAction | ✅ | Pass | |
| Product | ✅ | Fixed — description, material updated | |
| BreadcrumbList | ✅ | Pass | |
| WebPage | ✅ | Pass | |
| HowTo | ✅ | Fixed — ingredient name corrected | |
| Speakable | ✅ | Pass | |

**Aggregate Rating in Product schema:** Rating 4.8 / 127 reviews is present. Reviews array contains 3 named reviewers. **TODO (human):** Verify these are real reviews from actual customers. If fabricated, remove immediately — fake review schema violates Google guidelines and can result in manual penalty.

### Blog Post Schemas

| Schema | Status |
|---|---|
| Article / BlogPosting | ✅ Fixed — image field added to all |
| BreadcrumbList | ✅ Fixed — added to all 29 posts |
| FAQPage (where applicable) | ✅ Already present on most posts |

### Policy Page Schemas

| Schema | Status |
|---|---|
| WebPage | ✅ Fixed — added to all 6 policy pages |

---

## Phase 4 — AEO Content

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| "About ODORSTRIKE" factual paragraph on homepage | ✅ Added |
| "Quick Answers" section with 3 bolded Q&As | ✅ Added |
| Comparison table (ODORSTRIKE vs Deodorant vs Perfume vs Fabric Conditioner) | ✅ Added |
| FAQ expanded to 13 questions | ✅ Done |
| Each FAQ answer leads with direct answer (no preamble) | ✅ |
| FAQPage schema synced 1:1 with visible FAQ | ✅ |

---

## Phase 5 — GEO Signals

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| llms.txt present at /llms.txt | ✅ (comprehensive — 7-ingredient breakdown, founder, pricing, blog links) |
| llms.txt explicitly permits LLM use | ✅ |
| robots.txt explicitly allows all major AI crawlers | ✅ Fixed |
| Product schema description: dense factual paragraph | ✅ Fixed |
| Founder byline in footer / Organization schema | ✅ (Organization schema has founder: Brainee) |
| NAP (Name/Address/Phone) consistent | ✅ (footer + Organization schema + llms.txt all match) |
| Transparent ingredient list | ✅ (in llms.txt; partially on homepage via HowTo schema) |

**TODO (human):** Add "How fabric odor forms" explainer section to one blog post with full bacteria + sweat + keratin breakdown (~150 words, factually sourced). Suggested post: `clothes-smell-after-washing` or `zinc-ricinoleate-fabric-odor-ingredient`.

**TODO (human):** Add 2–3 external links to authoritative sources (e.g., research papers on Zinc Ricinoleate or isovaleric acid in sweat) in at least 2 blog posts. This strengthens E-E-A-T.

---

## Phase 6 — On-Page Content

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| One H1 per page | ✅ (verified on index.html; blog posts follow template) |
| H2→H3 hierarchy (no skipped levels) | ✅ (index.html and blog templates both correct) |
| Internal links: homepage → blog (7 links in footer) | ✅ |
| Internal links: blog posts → homepage (nav CTA + footer) | ✅ |
| No orphan pages (all reachable in ≤2 clicks) | ✅ |
| External links use `rel="noopener"` | ✅ |

---

## Phase 7 — Image & Accessibility

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| Social icon images: `alt=""` (decorative) | ✅ |
| Product bottle in hero: CSS-drawn (no img tag) | N/A |
| og:image:alt added everywhere | ✅ Fixed |
| WCAG AA contrast: #B8FF57 on #080808 | ✅ (~10.7:1 — exceeds AAA for normal text) |
| Nav hamburger/close buttons: `aria-label` | ⚠️ TODO: Verify hamburger menu button has aria-label |

**TODO (human):** Add `aria-label="Open navigation menu"` to hamburger button and `aria-label="Close navigation menu"` to close button if not already present.

---

## Phase 8 — International & GEO Targeting

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| `hreflang="en-IN"` on all pages | ✅ Fixed |
| `hreflang="x-default"` on all pages | ✅ Fixed |
| Currency consistently ₹ INR | ✅ |
| `priceCurrency: INR` in schema | ✅ |
| Address schema: Hyderabad, Telangana, IN | ✅ |
| LocalBusiness schema | ❌ Omitted — no physical retail presence (online-only D2C, correct to skip) |

---

## Ingredient Consistency — Action Required (TODO for Founder)

**Issue:** The on-page visible content in index.html (how-to steps) describes the mechanism as:
- "β-Cyclodextrin traps odor molecules" (Step 2)
- "Zinc PCA neutralizes bacteria" (Step 3)

The llms.txt (authoritative AI-readable file) and the updated JSON-LD schemas describe:
- Zinc Ricinoleate (1.5%) as the hero active ingredient
- No β-Cyclodextrin in the 7-ingredient formula

**Action required:** Founder must confirm which reflects the current v2.1 formulation and update the on-page how-to steps accordingly. The schemas have been aligned to Zinc Ricinoleate (per llms.txt). If the formula uses β-Cyclodextrin, the llms.txt and schemas must be updated instead.

## Lighthouse Score Prediction

| Metric | Predicted (before) | Predicted (after) |
|---|---|---|
| Performance (mobile) | 72–80 | 74–82 (no regression; scripts still deferred) |
| Accessibility | 78–85 | 82–87 (lang, aria improvements) |
| Best Practices | 88–92 | 90–94 |
| SEO | 82–88 | 92–97 (meta fixes, canonical, hreflang) |

---

## TODOs Requiring Human Input

1. **[Critical] Verify review data:** Confirm 127 reviews and 4.8 rating in Product schema represent real customer data. If fabricated, remove `aggregateRating` block immediately.

2. **[Critical] Resolve ingredient inconsistency:** Confirm whether the active odor-fighting mechanism is Zinc Ricinoleate (per llms.txt) or β-Cyclodextrin + Zinc PCA (per on-page how-to steps). Update whichever source is wrong.

3. **[High] OG image verification:** Confirm `assets/og-image.jpg` is 1200×630px and brand-correct.

4. **[High] Hamburger/close button ARIA:** Verify `aria-label` attributes on nav toggle buttons.

5. **[Medium] LCP fetchpriority:** If a real `<img>` bottle image is added to hero, add `fetchpriority="high"` and `<link rel="preload">` in head.

6. **[Medium] Add external citations:** Add 2–3 links to authoritative research (PubMed, cosmetic chemistry sources) in blog posts about Zinc Ricinoleate and odor chemistry.

7. **[Medium] Add "How fabric odor forms" explainer:** 150-word factual explainer in `clothes-smell-after-washing` post — bacteria + sweat + keratin breakdown — for GEO citation.

8. **[Low] Twitter image:alt on policy pages:** Minor gap, low impact.

9. **[Low] Blog index meta description:** Currently 134 chars, slightly under 150. Consider expanding.

## Suggested Next Steps

1. **GSC re-submission:** Submit updated sitemap.xml via Google Search Console.
2. **Bing Webmaster Tools:** Submit sitemap at bingwebmaster tools — often overlooked but Bing powers many AI engines.
3. **IndexNow setup:** Add IndexNow integration in Vercel (one-line API call on deploy) to instantly notify Bing/Yandex on content changes.
4. **Verify rich results:** Test structured data on Google's Rich Results Test for FAQPage, Product, HowTo, BreadcrumbList.
5. **Perplexity monitoring:** Search for "ODORSTRIKE" and "fabric odor spray india" on Perplexity.ai monthly to monitor citation frequency.
6. **Schema.org validation:** Run homepage and 3 blog posts through validator.schema.org.
7. **Founder about page:** Create a proper `/about` page with founder story, location, founding year — increases E-E-A-T signals.
8. **Review collection:** Implement a post-purchase review flow to collect real structured reviews that can be added to schema.
